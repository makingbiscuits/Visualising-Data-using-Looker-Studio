### The task:

Your colleague is very happy with the dashboard you provided him the previous week, but he has some remarks about the overall look of the dashboard. He saw that some metrics and dimensions were not very clear, also he did not like some of the graphs formatting. Furthermore, he saw some examples of DataStudio dashboards actually plotting data in the map. He thinks it is really cool and would really like to see something like that in your end result of the dashboard.

- Write SQL queries to extract needed data, these queries should be well documented, with indentation and provided as custom queries in DataStudio dashboard.
- Provide your analysis in DataStudio or other data visualization tool of your choice the main requirement being that you use olist_db as your data source.
- You need to present at least one additional insight that either reinforces (or replaces the graphs in the original graph). Your audience is interested in business insights and your role is to identify and tell them a story via visuals.
- Additionally to the dashboard you have to provide a 10 min presentation (up to 10 slides) which would be business focused and would present only the most interesting 3-5 insights.
- See whether you can apply at least 2 techniques learned in this or previous sprints.
- Explore the data. See whether there are interesting data points that can give more insights to your presentation than previously established in the Hands On task.
- Provide analytical insights, what are the drawbacks of this analysis, what further analysis could you recommend?
- Do not forget how you should structure your presentation which you learnt during the first sprint of the first module.
